Updated to Lua 5.2 (beta) and fixed a bug in the cleanup sequence of Lua modules.

## Changes since v0.6.0

### Coral Library (libcoral)
- Improved the error message for when a type has no reflector even though its module is loaded (to report the module state).

### Lua Module (modules/lua)
- Updated the Lua core to version 5.2 beta.
- Fixed a bug where the Lua GC was triggered too late in the modules' unloading sequence, causing problems with missing reflectors.
- Removed support for handling the `dispose()` event from a Lua ModulePart. Support for this event was troublesome as it caused mutual dependency problems in the system teardown sequence. Any cleanup that was done in the `dispose()` event can be moved to the `disintegrate()` event, or simply rely on the Lua garbage collector.
- The Lua CG now performs a full collection cycle at the end of the `disintegrate()` phase.
