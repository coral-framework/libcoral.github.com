This release contains only minor fixes and usability improvements.

## Changes since v0.7.0

### Coral Library (libcoral)
- Changed `co::int32` from `long` to `int` on x86_32 in order to make all type-traits more portable.
- New header `co/reserved/RefCounted.h` contains a general-purpose base class for reference-counted objects that can be reused in Coral modules.

### CMake Package (FindCoral.cmake)
- Macro `CORAL_TARGET( targetName )` now automatically links the target with the Coral library.
- CMake minimum version bumped to 2.8.5.
